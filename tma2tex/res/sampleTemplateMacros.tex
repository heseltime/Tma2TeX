%% Theorema Symbols are defined as custom LaTeX commands here! (BEGIN)
%%
%% In no particular order, except that it generally matches the parsing rules found in tma2tex.wl, Part 1.C.1,
%%  these commands define the syntax for theorema symbols in the LaTeX output. The naming convention is
%%  to use the symbol name in the Theorema code, but without dollar signs or context path. 
%%
%% So for example, the symbol
%%  Theorema`Language`And$TM (with full context) becomes AndTM, and so on.
