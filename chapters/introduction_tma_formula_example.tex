An example \lstinline+Theorema`Common`$tmaEnv+ evaluation output showcasing Theorema formula structure is provided in Program \ref{tmaFormulaExpressionExample}: the structure and its functioning will be illustrated in Chapter \ref{cha:Theory} and serves as a setup reference at this point.

\begin{program}
\caption{This is an example for a Theorema forumla (WL) expression, as evaluated on this author's system by entering \lstinline+Theorema`Common`$tmaEnv+ in a new cell in Mathematica Desktop and hitting shift + enter: The data is a List of \lstinline+Theorema`Common`FML$+-expressions, truncated after the first occurrence of such a formula.}
