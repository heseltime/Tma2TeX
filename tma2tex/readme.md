## Intro

This Software Engineering thesis project at Hagenberg Campus (FHOÃ–, AUT) is developed from a [notebook-based prototype](https://github.com/heseltime/prototype-wolfram-lang-theorema-to-latex) detailing some of the thought and ideas going into the design. The framework for the Mathematica/Wolfram Language native approach taken here is [Theorema](https://risc.jku.at/sw/theorema/) ([RISC](https://risc.jku.at/) at Johannes Kepler University, AUT). Thesis forthcoming.
