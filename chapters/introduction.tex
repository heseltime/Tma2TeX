\section{Mathematica}

Here could go an introduction to Mathematica and especially, Wolfram Language. Observe the spacing between lines and make an educated guess for how much room there is for the different sections and topics overall. Plan ahead of time!

\section{Narrative Citations}

The following is copoed from literature.

For narrative citations, the reference is used as the subject or object of the
sentence. The year is placed after the author's name in parentheses. To create
this kind of citation use 
%
\begin{itemize}
\item[] \verb!\textcite{!\textit{keys}\verb!}!.
\end{itemize}
%
\textbf{Example:}
\textcite{Daniel2018} give a brief introduction to \latex, whereas \textcite{Oetiker2021, Kopka2003} 
go into more detail.
